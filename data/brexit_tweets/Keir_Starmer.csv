784,2019-03-24 11:56:21+00:00,the prime minister has lost control of brexit and thrown our country into crisis this week parliament must be given the chance to take control ,Keir_Starmer
785,2019-03-24 11:29:11+00:00,this is a classic response from the government having lost control of events the brexit secretary indicates the government would frustrate any attempt by parliament to break the deadlock we are only in this crisis because ministers have pushed parliament away at every turn ,Keir_Starmer
786,2019-03-21 20:09:43+00:00,whatever happens in the coming days one thing is clear the prime minister has no mandate and no right to threaten our country with a no deal brexit if she is unwilling to show leadership at a time of national crisis then parliament must be given the chance to do so ,Keir_Starmer
791,2019-03-18 10:07:04+00:00,another powerful international law voice relying on article vienna convention to get the pm s brexit deal through would be an obvious exam failing non starter ,Keir_Starmer
792,2019-03-18 09:57:39+00:00,powerful analysis from leading international lawyer any attempt by govt to rely on article vienna convention to break brexit deadlock would be entirely without merit ,Keir_Starmer

843,2019-02-07 12:52:34+00:00,this letter sets out in robust terms that the prime minister must abandon her brexit red lines it does not take the option of a public vote off the table ,Keir_Starmer
848,2019-02-02 19:26:41+00:00,if confirmed this represents a serious blow to the communities that depend on the jobs nissan creates and supports the tories chaotic handling of the brexit negotiations is having a devastating impact on business investment it s time ministers got a grip on this crisis ,Keir_Starmer

868,2019-01-15 07:29:19+00:00,this evening parliament finally gets the chance to pass its verdict on two years of failed negotiation labour has always made clear that we won t support a bad brexit deal today we deliver on that promise ,Keir_Starmer
874,2019-01-10 18:13:17+00:00,number is simply wrong it would be unthinkable for mps to only be allowed minutes to decide what happens next in the event the government s brexit deal is voted down as ever the prime minister is simply seeking to shut down debate ,Keir_Starmer
875,2019-01-10 13:00:17+00:00,contemptible but in keeping with the govt s brexit approach to date mps will not tolerate this ,Keir_Starmer
878,2019-01-09 14:31:25+00:00,the government s decision to delay the meaningful vote has run down the clock and increased the risk of a no deal brexit if the prime minister s brexit deal is defeated next week she must return to parliament as soon as possible and give mps a real say on what happens next ,Keir_Starmer
879,2019-01-09 12:44:17+00:00,the prime minister s reassurances on her brexit deal amount to nothing the government could never have frozen parliament out of the choice of extending transition or entering the backstop pm has not delivered the significant changes that she promised ,Keir_Starmer
880,2019-01-09 10:01:54+00:00,if the prime minister s brexit deal is rejected parliament must decide what happens next this amendment has labour s full support ,Keir_Starmer

894,2018-12-19 11:26:21+00:00,a no deal brexit would be catastrophic no government has the right to plunge the country into chaos because of its own failure the majority in parliament must have its voice heard that s why i will be applying for this emergency debate today ,Keir_Starmer
896,2018-12-14 06:41:20+00:00,it seems that the prime minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her brexit deal we cannot go on like this the prime minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let parliament take back control ,Keir_Starmer
898,2018-12-12 22:12:23+00:00,result also shows how badly the pm would have lost the vote last night on her brexit deal had she not cancelled it again more trouble ahead ,Keir_Starmer

908,2018-12-01 23:04:54+00:00,so the pm insists that mps cannot see the ag s legal advice on brexit while members of the cabinet feel free to leak it completely unacceptable ,Keir_Starmer
924,2018-11-27 12:12:16+00:00,my letter to david lidington demanding publication of the government s full legal advice on its brexit deal in the next two days parliament is entitled to know full legal implications of what the prime minister has signed up to full transparency and rigorous scrutiny essential ,Keir_Starmer
