314,2019-11-04 13:13:08+00:00,this makes a no deal brexit a significant risk in fact given the likely impossibility of agreeing a trade deal in less than a year it would make it almost inevitable in a nutshell this is a reason to get tory mps out is the challenger in all scottish tory seats ,NicolaSturgeon

345,2019-10-27 09:56:07+00:00, finally all of this brexit chaos is being imposed on scotland against our will to stop this ever happening again we need to be independent which is why the demand for will be at heart of campaign ends,NicolaSturgeon
347,2019-10-27 09:51:45+00:00, to change the course johnson is taking us on we need to beat him i accept that challenge for in scotland other parties have to do the same elsewhere in uk doing nothing almost guarantees he gets what he wants brexit delivered possibly through no deal ,NicolaSturgeon
348,2019-10-27 09:51:15+00:00, for all his bluster johnson would much prefer to fight an election with brexit already delivered an election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his october do or die promise and also defend his bad deal ,NicolaSturgeon
355,2019-10-25 08:30:50+00:00,as the brexit chaos continues a message from me and to eu nationals living in scotland ,NicolaSturgeon
357,2019-10-24 17:12:14+00:00,so johnson appears to be saying to mps if you vote for an election i ll bring back my bad brexit bill and try to drag us out of the eu before we go to the polls elections should be exercises in letting voters decide not devices for charlatans to get their own way ,NicolaSturgeon
360,2019-10-21 16:55:52+00:00,we ve seen today that even the westminster brexit secretary hasn t yet grasped the details of this deal trying to ram through legislation of this complexity significance and long lasting consequences in just days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy ,NicolaSturgeon
374,2019-10-19 09:45:05+00:00,johnson has broken virtually every past promise he has made on brexit how anyone could believe promises he makes now on workers rights or anything else is beyond me caveat emptor should be the words ringing in ears of any labour mp thinking of backing this deal ,NicolaSturgeon
377,2019-10-18 16:57:36+00:00,very proud of this guy as leader of westminster group has played a blinder opposing brexit and standing up for scotland good to catch up with him in his commons office earlier ,NicolaSturgeon
379,2019-10-18 12:26:52+00:00,good to catch up with the snp mp group in the commons today so proud of the work they do to stand up for scotland s interests every day they re doing everything possible to stop brexit but also demonstrating that the best future for scotland is independence ,NicolaSturgeon
381,2019-10-18 06:22:28+00:00,hope i m wrong but i have a real suspicion that labour would be quite happy to see this deal go through they will officially oppose but give nod to rebels to ensure numbers there to pass it will be the end of them in scotland if they do end up facilitating brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
384,2019-10-17 10:49:05+00:00, brexit has shown that the only way for scotland to be in charge of our own future is to become independent that why we must have next year,NicolaSturgeon
385,2019-10-17 10:48:38+00:00, mps should not fall for a deal no deal framing no brexit revoke is always an alternative to no deal ,NicolaSturgeon
387,2019-10-17 10:46:15+00:00, seems to me that no one who voted against may s deal on basis it lacked strong enough assurances about closeness of future relationship could possibly vote for this much harder brexit beckons if this deal passes ,NicolaSturgeon
403,2019-10-08 10:28:14+00:00,the uk government s attempt to shift the blame for the brexit fiasco to anyone but themselves today it s merkel is pathetically transparent ,NicolaSturgeon
423,2019-10-02 15:11:43+00:00,hard to see how the uk government brexit proposals fly and hard to escape conclusion that they re designed to fail for scotland the fundamental point remains these proposals would take us out of the eu single market and customs union against our will that s unacceptable ,NicolaSturgeon
426,2019-09-30 16:21:35+00:00,hard to overstate how big a blunder supporting a no deal brexit is from jackson carlaw ,NicolaSturgeon
428,2019-09-30 06:43:59+00:00,in supporting a catastrophic no deal brexit the scottish tories are putting the demands of boris johnson ahead of the interests of the scottish people who voted overwhelmingly against any kind of brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
451,2019-09-25 18:22:56+00:00,johnson should stop his shameful game playing if he requests an extension and removes risk of no deal on october will vote for an election the ball s in his court but he must think we button up the back if he believes we ll let him force through a no deal brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
454,2019-09-24 12:28:23+00:00,he can t have it both ways either prorogation was nothing to do with brexit as he claimed or having prorogation declared unlawful frustrates brexit it can t be both ,NicolaSturgeon
458,2019-09-23 16:50:46+00:00,labour rejects a clear pro remain position and instead stays firmly perched on the brexit fence an abdication of leadership ,NicolaSturgeon
475,2019-09-17 21:57:54+00:00, staying neutral on brexit is a shameful abdication of leadership ,NicolaSturgeon
510,2019-09-06 11:52:47+00:00, and when the election does come as it soon will will put scotland s opposition to brexit and our right to choose our own future as an independent nation at the very heart of the contest ,NicolaSturgeon
512,2019-09-06 11:48:39+00:00, an early general election is now a question of when not if but johnson mustn t be allowed to dictate the timing as a device to avoid scrutiny and force through a no deal brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
515,2019-09-04 11:31:25+00:00, not allowing johnson to cut and run for an election simply as a tactic to force through a no deal brexit is one thing and why opposition right to insist on passage of anti no deal bill but ,NicolaSturgeon
518,2019-09-03 21:34:21+00:00,scotland voted to remain in the eu and yet not a single scottish tory mp voted to prevent a no deal brexit tonight ,NicolaSturgeon
522,2019-09-02 11:53:57+00:00,as talk of a general election mounts i say bring it on but it must be before oct mps must not allow johnson to game the date as a ploy to push through a no deal brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
539,2019-08-28 16:05:50+00:00,open letter on the eve of poll from the excellent say no to brexit vote snp ,NicolaSturgeon
543,2019-08-28 09:09:22+00:00,given her past statements opposing a no deal brexit it would be good to have confirmation from ruth davidson today that all scots tory mps will back the cross party effort next week to stop it and that they will also oppose boris johnson s attempt to shut down parliament ,NicolaSturgeon
544,2019-08-28 08:13:30+00:00,so it seems that boris johnson may actually be about to shut down parliament to force through a no deal brexit unless mps come together to stop him next week today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for uk democracy ,NicolaSturgeon
566,2019-08-15 12:22:05+00:00,to be clear remains willing to work across party lines and explore all options to stop a no deal brexit jeremy corbyn s suggestion is not the only possible option but given the circumstances nothing should be ruled out at this stage should rethink ,NicolaSturgeon
636,2019-07-23 12:04:23+00:00, most immediately i and will work with others to do everything we can to block his plan for a no deal brexit which would do catastrophic harm to scotland ,NicolaSturgeon
774,2019-06-12 11:00:23+00:00,ruth davidson is supporting a candidate who says he favours a catastrophic no deal brexit over no brexit at all what a turn around from the great remainer of wembley stadium and hard to imagine a position more out of touch with the vast majority in scotland ,NicolaSturgeon
777,2019-06-10 08:43:01+00:00,what a horror show the tory leadership election is tax cuts for the richest attacks on abortion rights hypocrisy on drugs continued brexit delusion true colours well and truly on show ,NicolaSturgeon
808,2019-05-30 13:32:32+00:00, some way off can someone tell jeremy that a disastrous no deal brexit on october is currently the default option he needs to get off the fence asap and support a second referendum unequivocally there is no time to waste ,NicolaSturgeon
809,2019-05-29 20:21:02+00:00,this is jaw dropping from telling people in that brexit would be a disaster to now seeking support for a tory candidate because he voted for brexit there is not a shred of principle or consistency at play here ,NicolaSturgeon
812,2019-05-29 08:54:29+00:00,just published a bill to set the rules for an independence referendum to allow the scottish people to choose our own future rather than having a brexit future imposed on us will update later on it and our plans for cross party talks and a citizens assembly,NicolaSturgeon
819,2019-05-27 11:22:53+00:00,congratulations to our new meps and and thanks to all our fantastic candidates thank you also to all who voted for us and delivered this historic result scotland has spoken we are not for brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
821,2019-05-27 00:06:13+00:00,obviously i m delighted with result but genuinely sad for he has been an excellent mep and passionately anti brexit he was one of the very last labour people who deserved to pay the price for his party s prevarication ,NicolaSturgeon
823,2019-05-26 23:30:33+00:00,formal declaration to come but clear now that has won the euro election emphatically we are on course to take out of seats a historic victory and scotland has rejected brexit again ,NicolaSturgeon
826,2019-05-26 22:57:57+00:00,outstanding results so far tonight for on course for our best ever euro election result polling way ahead of any other party higher in scotland than brexit party s current share in ruk emphatically clear that scotland doesn t want brexit,NicolaSturgeon
834,2019-05-24 10:32:15+00:00,that boris johnson as pm is a serious proposition is proof that the tories have taken leave of their senses nothing apart from brexit obvs has done more to trash the uk s global reputation in last three years than his risible tenure as foreign secretary,NicolaSturgeon
836,2019-05-24 09:24:21+00:00, the prospect of an even more hardline brexiteer now becoming pm and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning added to the experience of the past three years this makes it all the more important that scotland is given the choice of becoming an independent country ,NicolaSturgeon
837,2019-05-24 09:21:38+00:00, her departure will not solve the brexit mess that the tories have created only putting the matter back to the people can do that given current circumstances it also feels deeply wrong for another tory to be installed in number without a general election ,NicolaSturgeon
838,2019-05-24 09:21:03+00:00, i wish theresa may well she and i had profound disagreements not least on her handling of brexit and her disregard for scotland s interests however leadership is tough especially in these times and she deserves thanks for her service ,NicolaSturgeon
864,2019-05-22 07:02:05+00:00,there s a pattern here when bad things look unlikely to happen ie brexit before the referendum or boris as pm a few months ago ruth davidson opposes them because it s safe but when these things do happen or look likely to she falls meekly into line that s not leadership ,NicolaSturgeon
866,2019-05-21 16:44:13+00:00,met earlier with people from other eu countries who live in scotland my message is that they are welcome here and we want them to stay by voting on thursday scotland can send a clear message that we don t want brexit and all the damage it will do ,NicolaSturgeon
868,2019-05-21 15:37:57+00:00, in pm s own words if mps vote against the bill they will be voting to stop brexit that is what will do because scotland did not vote for brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
872,2019-05-20 13:14:42+00:00,good visit with to fish processor j charles in aberdeen earlier to hear concerns about the damage brexit will do to business thanks to andrew and his team for the warm welcome,NicolaSturgeon
883,2019-05-17 10:57:55+00:00,delighted to launch manifesto for the with our fantastic team of candidates on thursday let s send a clear message that scotland s not for brexit scotland s for europe ,NicolaSturgeon
884,2019-05-15 18:57:49+00:00,the recommendation to voters in scotland from this research is explicit and clear if you want to stop brexit vote ,NicolaSturgeon
888,2019-05-15 12:46:13+00:00,great visit to my alma mater this morning to talk about the work they are doing to support staff and students from other eu countries during the brexit uncertainty thanks for the welcome and for giving me one of the uni s new diversity badges ,NicolaSturgeon
914,2019-05-03 20:09:09+00:00,for some bad jokes tired lines and ample evidence that the tories are way out of touch with scottish opinion on brexit here s a preview of ruth davidson s conference speech courtesy of the tories who forgot to switch the mic off during the practice ,NicolaSturgeon
920,2019-05-03 07:57:39+00:00,the scottish tories have got themselves in a corner they are now a brexit supporting party in an overwhelmingly remain country which already narrows appeal but they also can t even claim to have delivered brexit not much principle or strategic nous on display ,NicolaSturgeon
922,2019-05-03 07:36:18+00:00,if the message labour takes from english local elections is that they should now be the facilitator of a tory brexit i suspect their troubles will just be beginning ,NicolaSturgeon
935,2019-04-30 16:14:11+00:00,confirmation if it was needed that labour is a brexit supporting party problem is a labour brexit just like a tory brexit will hurt scotland so if you want to keep scotland in europe and make sure that our voice is heard vote on may ,NicolaSturgeon
979,2019-04-18 07:30:58+00:00,this is an excellent piece by about how we learn from the grave errors of the brexiteers build an inclusive case for independence and value the bonds of friendship that will always endure across our islands well worth a read ,NicolaSturgeon
992,2019-04-13 08:58:06+00:00,great piece from whose clarity of insight and commentary on brexit is always first class ,NicolaSturgeon
1006,2019-04-06 20:26:57+00:00,if the detail of this is true and i accept it is only an if labour will never be forgiven a deal that would see them vote for a tory brexit with a nod and a wink agreement to kill off a people s vote ,NicolaSturgeon
1032,2019-04-02 08:00:12+00:00,this blog from explains why snp mps voted as we did last night we prioritised options that would stop brexit and remove the risk of a no deal exit but we also showed a willingness to compromise by voting for a single market customs unions option ,NicolaSturgeon
1034,2019-04-01 16:14:12+00:00,genuinely can t think of any good reason why labour mps would not vote for option tonight it provides an insurance policy against a no deal brexit and doesn t mean that article couldn t be triggered again in future if uk manages to work out what it wants ,NicolaSturgeon
1036,2019-04-01 12:50:11+00:00,really important to remember that tonight s votes are not on a preferential basis an snp vote for sm cu would only be to keep that option alive in case it later becomes only alternative to a harder brexit our preference is stopping brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
1037,2019-04-01 08:52:01+00:00,snp will decide votes when we see detail of what is selected later today s vote is not on a preferential basis so there may be an opportunity to keep alive least worst options against no deal hard brexit but to be clear our preference is not soft brexit it is no brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
1038,2019-04-01 08:14:34+00:00,today in scotland the new domestic abuse act comes into force free personal care is extended to the under s prescription charges rise to in england but remain without charge here as the uk government is consumed by brexit is getting on with the job ,NicolaSturgeon
1039,2019-04-01 07:39:12+00:00,the most important motion laid today is this one from it makes revoking article rather than a no deal brexit the default option if parliament can t agree a way forward i hope all parties will support ,NicolaSturgeon
1051,2019-03-29 17:34:08+00:00,so while the tories say this about labour their attack line on the snp in scotland is that today s vote will cause a no deal brexit someone should tell them we can see all their tweets but just so they re in no doubt the snp is trying to stop brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
1058,2019-03-29 10:22:41+00:00,labour mps are not really about to save pm s skin and usher in a tory brexit are they ,NicolaSturgeon
1061,2019-03-29 08:39:58+00:00,a very welcome ray of sunshine in this otherwise sad sorry brexit mess has been the laugh out loud brilliance of ,NicolaSturgeon
1066,2019-03-28 17:03:15+00:00,part of the problem already with the withdrawal agreement and political declaration is that it means agreeing to leave the eu with no clarity about the future ie a blindfold brexit take away the pd completely and that problem is compounded why would mps agree to that ,NicolaSturgeon
1068,2019-03-28 07:29:43+00:00,some nice non brexit news spring has sprung can t wait to start this at the weekend ,NicolaSturgeon
1069,2019-03-27 21:05:54+00:00,the first preference of has always been to stop brexit if that s not possible and until relatively recently it seemed it wasn t we d opt for soft brexit over hard but stopping brexit is possible now and we voted tonight to give that the best chance ,NicolaSturgeon
1071,2019-03-27 17:37:00+00:00,if brexit ends up being forced through on the basis of a deal no one supports indeed a deal so bad that the pm has to promise to resign to get it through it will make an already bad project even worse ,NicolaSturgeon
1072,2019-03-27 17:25:10+00:00,any mp who is serious about stopping a no deal brexit has to vote for amendment tonight it s as simple as that ,NicolaSturgeon
1085,2019-03-22 13:33:42+00:00,i ll be proud to speak at the march tomorrow scotland voted to remain in but people across the uk must have the chance to get out of this brexit mess whatever scotland s future i hope independent it is in all of our interests for uk to be in the eu ,NicolaSturgeon
1091,2019-03-21 21:50:03+00:00,so it seems the eu will give uk an extra two weeks to avoid a no deal brexit imperative now that parliament takes control away from pm and uses that time to agree a way forward preferably asking for a longer extension to put the issue back to voters ,NicolaSturgeon
1095,2019-03-21 14:05:41+00:00,an issue as big and important as brexit should not come down to petitions that said if you are frustrated that the pm is just not listening you can sign here ,NicolaSturgeon
1100,2019-03-20 12:14:32+00:00,about to chair a meeting of resilience committee preparing for the possibility of a no deal brexit only upside is that it saves me from and listening to this weak pm failing to stand up to the hardliners and risking no deal instead she needs to go ,NicolaSturgeon
1101,2019-03-20 10:31:01+00:00,and the feeling grows that ultimately labour will be the handmaidens of a tory brexit i so want to be proved wrong on this in spite of the fact that it would be their political death knell in scotland ,NicolaSturgeon
1106,2019-03-19 12:10:30+00:00,and still the pm s choice is to pander to the hard brexiteers instead of trying to find a more inclusive way forward so utterly wrongheaded ,NicolaSturgeon
1127,2019-03-14 09:34:52+00:00,if you are a brexiteer what does it say about your project if it has to be founded on a deal that a majority believes to be fundamentally flawed that cannot be the way to proceed which is why pm should accept defeat change course and accept this opportunity for a rethink,NicolaSturgeon
1135,2019-03-12 20:14:12+00:00,my comment on tonight s brexit fiasco ,NicolaSturgeon
1160,2019-03-07 16:39:51+00:00,just chaired the latest meeting of resilience meeting on plans for no deal brexit these meetings look at things like supply of medicines and food economic and community impact it s disgraceful that pm s refusal to rule out a no deal exit makes this necessary ,NicolaSturgeon
1173,2019-03-05 09:02:31+00:00,watching this makes me feel sad and angry in equal measure tove danish born has lived in scotland for years and asks this reasonable question at why do i have to register the one word answer is brexit tove this is your home scotland wants you here ,NicolaSturgeon
1184,2019-02-28 21:41:25+00:00,the justification here from a uk minister for trying to block scotland s right to choose independence is quite something once youve hit the iceberg youre all on it together well actually no scotland does not have to sink with the brexit ship ,NicolaSturgeon
1213,2019-02-22 14:23:42+00:00,that makes more sense as a way forward though of course in scotland already has a party that wants to stop brexit his explanation for why labour lost though is way off the mark imo,NicolaSturgeon
1218,2019-02-21 14:57:08+00:00,the tory finance spokesperson has just given a woeful minute speech in the budget debate without even mentioning the biggest risk facing scotland s budget and economy tory brexit incredible ,NicolaSturgeon
1219,2019-02-20 12:30:22+00:00,unusually heard a bit of striking how symbiotic the may corbyn relationship seems collusion of silence on their imploding parties neither showing any leadership on brexit and each one relying on the other s incompetence to obscure their own ,NicolaSturgeon

1253,2019-02-12 06:36:41+00:00,this is a pm clearly prepared to take the uk to the brink and potentially over the cliff edge rather than face down the zealot brexiteers in her own party this mess is not inevitable it is a choice she is making ,NicolaSturgeon

1474,2018-11-21 09:27:24+00:00,point i was making yesterday is that opposition must unite behind an agreed alternative i am happy for that to be another vote but we still have to persuade others for that to command a majority and in meantime keep all alternatives to hard brexit open ,NicolaSturgeon

1622,2018-09-20 07:57:25+00:00,a blind brexit with little or no detail on terms of future eu uk relationship would be no more acceptable than a no deal brexit if that s the choice article should be extended to allow all alternative options for scotland and uk to be considered ,NicolaSturgeon
1701,2018-08-23 14:55:38+00:00,a no deal brexit would be an unmitigated disaster and the fact that uk govt is even talking about it is evidence of their abject failure that they once had the nerve to tell us that independence threatened our place in europe adds insult to injury scotland deserves better ,NicolaSturgeon
