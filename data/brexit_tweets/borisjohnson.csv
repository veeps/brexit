833,2019-05-27 08:54:06+00:00,the message from last night s results is clear it is time for us to deliver brexit and set out our positive plans for the country ,BorisJohnson
834,2019-05-24 09:40:11+00:00,a very dignified statement from thank you for your stoical service to our country and the conservative party it is now time to follow her urgings to come together and deliver brexit ,BorisJohnson
867,2019-04-15 09:05:55+00:00,don t despair don t give up brexit is going to happen and when it does we must finally begin the positive narrative of brexit britain tackling crime investing in our health service and our schools and fixing the housing market to help young people own their own homes ,BorisJohnson
875,2019-04-02 18:27:58+00:00,it is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of brexit to jeremy corbyn and the labour party it now seems all too likely that british trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to brussels with no say for the u k ,BorisJohnson
878,2019-03-29 09:41:55+00:00,it is very painful to vote for this deal but i hope we can now work together to remedy its defects avoid the backstop trap and strive to deliver the brexit people voted for,BorisJohnson
879,2019-03-29 09:41:22+00:00,we therefore run the risk of being forced to accept an even worse version of brexit or losing brexit altogether a bad deal that we have a chance to improve in the next stage of negotiations must be better than those alternatives,BorisJohnson
896,2019-02-24 22:28:14+00:00,i am getting sick of the constant suggestion that anyone who sticks up for brexit must have far right tendencies,BorisJohnson
914,2019-01-21 09:37:11+00:00,there are large numbers of mps though not i think a majority who want to stop brexit they want to frustrate the will of the people but there are three giant facts that mean or so i hope and believe that they will fail,BorisJohnson
919,2019-01-14 22:30:34+00:00,when this deal is voted down let us not continue to flog this dead horse instead we must get brexit right and seize the opportunities before us,BorisJohnson
945,2018-11-27 14:20:25+00:00,there is no point having a debate with two people who voted remain deals that don t take back control any debate must involve someone who believes in brexit the british people being fully in control of their laws rather than giving back control to the eu like the pms deal,BorisJohnson
946,2018-11-27 14:19:25+00:00,debates are great for democracy but rather than widening discourse this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between may s failing deal and corbyn s vague proposals neither of which are brexit ,BorisJohnson
949,2018-11-24 10:36:26+00:00,our hopes of ending the barbaric trade of sending live animals abroad for slaughter will almost certainly be dashed by the appalling sell out brexit deal,BorisJohnson
950,2018-11-22 17:02:57+00:00,nothing in this political declaration changes the fact that this deal gives the eu a continuing veto over the unilateral power over the entire u k to do trade deals or take back control of our laws we must junk the backstop or we make a nonsense of brexit,BorisJohnson
951,2018-11-19 09:04:59+00:00,we should insist that our government finally gets behind brexit and shows some basic confidence and enthusiasm and belief in this great project,BorisJohnson
953,2018-11-13 10:21:44+00:00,we still have time to go for something better a supercanada free trade deal that will allow the uk to benefit from brexit and actually respect the referendum the future can be bright if only we change course now ,BorisJohnson
958,2018-11-09 16:07:09+00:00,boundless admiration as ever for my brother jo we may not have agreed about brexit but we are united in dismay at the intellectually and politically indefensible of the uk position ,BorisJohnson
959,2018-11-05 07:04:57+00:00,brexit was meant to be about taking back control under this plan we surrender control to brussels if we accept this appalling deal we must realise it is forever not just for christmas ,BorisJohnson
963,2018-10-31 10:47:06+00:00,excellent piece by who rightly points out we must embrace the opportunities of brexit,BorisJohnson
969,2018-10-15 16:06:05+00:00,we must be clear that we can genuinely vary our tariffs and do free trade deals or it will be brexit in name only and we will betray the british people a deadline is essential,BorisJohnson
